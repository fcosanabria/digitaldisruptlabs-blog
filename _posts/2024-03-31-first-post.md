This is my introductory post. I'm learning how to use [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/) so I can share my notes with you.

It's been a fun experience running around choosing which type of Static Site Generator engine to use. Of course, it's time consuming, but fun. In the end, it was like an excuse to procrastinate.

I'm going to do my best to try to publish as often as possible. But you have to keep in mind that I also need to run other pages like the content for Digital Death Disript. So there might be days when I post a lit of things in a row and others not so much. But the point is to try to do consistently, maybe not every day, but quite frequently.
